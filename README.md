# Student OS — PB138

> An all-in-one hub for university student life, powered by an AI copilot and a first-class teacher-student communication layer.

Built as a university project for PB138 — Web Development Principles, Masaryk University Brno.

## What is this?

Student OS is the single app a student opens every morning and a teacher opens before every class. Three things make it different from a plain study tracker:

1. **Everything in one place** — tasks, notes, courses, timeline, and teacher-assigned work unified in a single shell
2. **AI copilot** — an AI that knows your deadlines, workload, and notes, and proactively helps you manage your week
3. **Teacher-student channel** — teachers assign students to courses, publish study materials, create assignments for the whole class, and evaluate submitted work

---

## What it can do

### As a Student
- **Today view** — personalized daily screen: week strip, tasks for today, upcoming deadlines, AI summary of your week
- **Tasks** — personal tasks + subtasks, filter by status/due date, AI priority scoring; teacher-assigned tasks appear here automatically tagged with the course
- **Courses** — enrolled courses with progress tracking; each course opens a tabbed detail view:
  - *Overview* — schedule, teacher info, next class, upcoming deadlines
  - *Tasks* — all tasks linked to this course
  - *Materials* — study materials uploaded by the teacher (links + descriptions)
  - *My Grades* — all evaluations for this course with score + feedback
- **Notes** — personal notes organized in folders, linkable to courses, AI can summarize them on demand
- **Timeline** — calendar view of events and deadlines, AI-suggested study blocks pushed directly from the plan generator
- **AI Copilot** — persistent right-side panel with three modes:
  - *Proactive feed* — polished cards that warn you about overload, nudge high-priority tasks, celebrate progress
  - *Chat* — ask anything ("What should I study today?", "Summarize my PB138 notes")
  - *Weekly plan generator* — AI reads your tasks and calendar, generates a day-by-day study schedule, one click pushes it to Timeline
- **Notifications** — bell icon in the header (unread badge) for hard notifications: new assignment, new material, evaluation received; clicking navigates directly to the relevant resource; AI panel handles contextual nudges separately
- **Global search** — CMD+K command palette searches across tasks, notes, courses, and study materials at once; results grouped by type
- **More** — catch-all drawer: Profile/Settings, Groups, Pomodoro timer, About/Help

### As a Teacher
- **My Classes** — all courses you teach, class roster, today's sessions, count of pending evaluations
- **Assignments** — create assignments for a course, set due date and description (AI can draft it), publish to all enrolled students at once; students cannot self-enroll — teachers control the roster entirely
- **Evaluations** — grade submitted student work with score + feedback, view per-student progress across a course
- **Study Materials** — attach links and descriptions to a course; enrolled students see them in the Materials tab of the course detail
- **Students** — enroll and remove students per course, search by name/email, view each student's task completion status
- **AI Insights** — class performance overview, which students are falling behind, aggregate submission stats

### Role toggle
A user can hold both Student and Teacher roles (e.g. PhD students). A small pill in the sidebar switches the entire navigation context without logging out. On mobile, the same 5-slot bottom nav shifts meaning on role toggle (Today→Classes, Tasks→Assign, Courses→Grades, Notes→Students, More→More).

New users are always **Student** by default. The **Teacher** role is granted exclusively by an Admin via the admin panel — no self-declaration.

## How it works

```
Browser
  └── React + TanStack Router (file-based routing)
        ├── Sidebar (role-aware nav) + AI panel strip
        ├── Student screens: Today, Tasks, Courses, Notes, Timeline
        ├── Teacher screens: My Classes, Assignments, Evaluations, Materials, Students
        └── AI Copilot panel (proactive feed / chat / plan generator)

PostgreSQL via Supabase (Drizzle ORM)
  └── users, tasks, events, notes, courses, assignments, evals,
      study_materials, audit_logs, emails, ...

E-infra AI API (university AI infrastructure)
  └── Powers /ai routes — context assembled server-side from user's own data
      Student data is never visible to teachers through AI
```

## Key design decisions

- **Soft delete everywhere** — `deleted_at` column, never hard DELETE
- **Audit log on every mutation** — INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE → `audit_logs`
- **Ownership enforced server-side** — users can only read/modify their own data
- **AI context is scoped** — the AI only sees the authenticated user's data; teacher AI insights use aggregate stats only
- **Teacher assignments auto-create tasks** — publishing an assignment creates one task per enrolled student, linked to the assignment and course
- **Role toggle, not separate logins** — one account can hold multiple roles

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TanStack Router |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS (dark mode via `class`) |
| Validation | Zod |
| Backend | Bun + ElysiaJS + TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Supabase |

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @pb138/frontend dev   # frontend on http://localhost:5173
bun run dev                          # backend on http://localhost:3001 (from apps/backend/)
```

Database is hosted on Supabase — set `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/backend/.env` (see `.env.example`).

### Database

```bash
# From apps/backend/:
bun run db:generate   # generate migration from schema changes
bun run db:migrate    # apply migrations
bun run db:push       # push schema directly (dev only)
```

### Run tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @pb138/frontend test       # Vitest unit tests
pnpm --filter @pb138/frontend test:e2e   # Playwright E2E
bun test                                  # Backend unit tests (from apps/backend/)
```
